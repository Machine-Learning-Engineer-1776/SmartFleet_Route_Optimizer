# SmartFleet_Route_Optimizer

**Project Overview:**
SmartFleet Route Optimizer is an AI-powered web application designed to optimize fleet routing for taxi and transportation services in Chicago. It integrates multiple data sources—including crime statistics, weather forecasts, taxi trip records, ADAS-EV sensor data, Terra-D2 gyro sensor readings, traffic congestion metrics, and news sentiment analysis—to generate dynamic, risk-minimized routes. The app employs machine learning models for surge pricing calculation, crime prediction, weather forecasting, news sentiment classification, and sensor degradation modeling, enabling fleet operators to reduce operational costs, improve safety, and enhance efficiency.
This project demonstrates end-to-end ML engineering: from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, real-time inference, and interactive visualization. It simulates real-world scenarios, projecting up to 35% cost reductions and 18% lower collision risks through optimized routing. The app is live at http://35.89.230.31:8501/ and optimized for mobile accessibility, making it a scalable solution for urban fleet management.

**ML Models**

**Weather Prediction Model:** A regression-based model (e.g., linear regression) forecasting weather risks (e.g., temperature >80°F, precipitation >0.1 inches) using historical data, with synthetic generation for sparse inputs to enable proactive risk adjustments.
**News Sentiment LLM:** A fine-tuned large language model (e.g., BERT via Hugging Face) for classifying news articles into sentiment scores, integrated into the risk model to capture external event impacts on operations.
**Sensor Degradation Model:** A quadratic regression model predicting vision sensor failure rates based on humidity, combined with weighted risk scoring for ADAS and gyro sensors, projecting $27,000+ in annual maintenance savings.
**Composite Risk Model:** An ensemble approach aggregating predictions from crime, weather, sentiment, traffic, and sensor models, using Scikit-learn for feature scaling and NumPy for probabilistic simulations, optimizing routes with a 25.7% average cost reduction.
**Surge Pricing Model:** A rule-based ML model incorporating temporal and demand features, enhanced by ML-driven risk penalties to dynamically compute surge multipliers for operational efficiency.


These models were developed using **PyTorch**, **Scikit-learn**, and **NumPy**, with **MLflow** for experiment tracking, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.
