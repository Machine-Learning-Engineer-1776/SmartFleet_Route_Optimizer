# SmartFleet_Route_Optimizer

**Project Overview**

SmartFleet Route Optimizer is a cutting-edge, AI-powered web application designed to optimize fleet routing for taxi and transportation services in Chicago. By integrating diverse data sources—such as crime statistics, weather forecasts, taxi trip records, ADAS vision sensor data, Terra-D2 gyro sensor readings, and news sentiment analysis—the application generates dynamic, risk-minimized routes to enhance safety and operational efficiency.

The application leverages advanced machine learning models for real-time predictions, including surge pricing, crime risk, weather impacts, sentiment analysis, and sensor degradation. This enables fleet operators to reduce operational costs by up to 23.5% and lower collision risks through optimized routing. Deployed at http://35.89.230.31:8501/, the application is fully mobile-responsive, making it a scalable solution for urban fleet management.

**Machine Learning Models**

The application integrates multiple machine learning models to process and predict from diverse data sources, ensuring robust and actionable insights:

  •	**Crime Prediction Model:** A supervised classification model (e.g., Random Forest) trained on historical crime data to predict crime probabilities by zone and hour. Features are engineered using pivot-based methods to identify violent crime hotspots with high accuracy.

  •	**Weather Prediction Model:** A regression model (e.g., linear regression) forecasting weather risks based on temperature (>80°F) and precipitation (>0.1 inches), enhanced with synthetic data generation for robust risk assessment.

  •	**News Sentiment LLM:** A fine-tuned large language model (e.g., BERT via Hugging Face) classifying news articles into sentiment scores, integrated to capture external event impacts (e.g., protests, road closures) on routing decisions.

  •	**Sensor Degradation Model:** A quadratic regression model predicting ADAS vision sensor failure rates based on humidity, combined with weighted risk scoring for Terra-D2 gyro sensors, projecting up to $27,000 in annual maintenance savings.

  •	**Composite Risk Model:** An ensemble approach aggregating predictions from crime, weather, sentiment, and sensor models, using Scikit-learn for feature scaling and NumPy for probabilistic route optimization, achieving an average cost reduction of 21%.

  •	**Surge Pricing Model:** A rule-based model enhanced with machine learning to compute dynamic surge multipliers, incorporating temporal and demand features adjusted by risk penalties.
  
These models are built using **PyTorch**, **Scikit-learn**, and **NumPy**, with **MLflow** for experiment tracking to ensure reproducibility and scalability.
